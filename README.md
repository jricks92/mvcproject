mvcproject
==========
Dr. Anderson decided to make this a group project. However, each group member will be required to fill out a team evaluation.

For this project you can either get your own final project approved by the TAs/Professor Anderson or you can use the following. Make sure you keep this project simple!!! We are just introducing the basics of MVC web development.

Your project must include the following:

- Creation of at least 2 models (BUT YOU DO NOT NEED TO STORE THE DATA)

- Home page

- At least 2 linking pages

- Use of a combobox or list box during the input of the data (NOT STORING DATA THOUGH)

- Basic validation of a not null input

- Basic validation of an input (i.e. valid email use of '@')

- Displaying images

- Professional GUI presentation

- Use of CSS file

- Sending an email

- Comments in the code

If you choose to use the default project, you will need to create a page for the Information Systems Department. This page will display information about the undergraduate degreen and the master's degree. You can link to either degree to see the program requirements. There is also a page to show faculty pictures and info. Another page shows the Industry Advisory Board information (picture and bio for each member). 

You also MUST submit the team eval ON TIME or you get docked 50% !!!!
