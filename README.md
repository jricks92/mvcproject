mvcproject
==========
Dr. Anderson decided to make this a group project. However, each group member will be required to fill out a team evaluation.

For this project you can either get your own final project approved by the TAs/Professor Anderson or you can use the following. Make sure you keep this project simple!!! We are just introducing the basics of MVC web development.

Your project must include the following:

- Creation of at least 2 models (BUT YOU DO NOT NEED TO STORE THE DATA)

- Home page

- At least 2 linking pages

- Use of a combobox or list box during the input of the data (NOT STORING DATA THOUGH)

- Basic validation of a not null input

- Basic validation of an input (i.e. valid email use of '@')

- Displaying images

- Professional GUI presentation

- Use of CSS file

- Sending an email

- Comments in the code

If you choose to use the default project, you will need to create a page for the Information Systems Department. This page will display information about the undergraduate degree and the master's degree. You can link to either degree to see the program requirements. There is also a page to show faculty pictures and info. Another page shows the Industry Advisory Board information (picture and bio for each member). 

You also MUST submit the team eval ON TIME or you get docked 50% !!!!

UPDATE From Dr. Anderson: 12/11/14
==================================
IF YOU CHOOSE TO DO THE ONE I HAVE LISTED (which is probably easier)

-You will have a main page for the department.

-There will be a combobox or a list box that will either take them to a page showing the undergrad requirements or the graduate requirements.

-There is a link on the main page that will take you to a faculty page showing pictures (I don't care if they are real or not) and some info (name, etc. anything)

-There is a link that takes you to a page for the advisory board (just make up this info and pics).

-Have a link that if they click on it you send them an email to an address they enter in somewhere. I don't care what the email says.

-Or the faculty page just put a picture or 2. Same thing for the advisory page (make up content if you want).

Keep it very simple!
This shouldn't take more than 3 hours as a team.
BTW, this project HAS to be under 3 hours so if you choose my project it should be.
The team can divide up the pages and each page should take 20-30 minutes (keep it simple).
I have already given you the email code.
If each person on the team does a page you can bring them all together and easily be done with the 3 hours.

KEEP IT SIMPLE! NO DATABASE HELPS.

Choose wisely if you are doing your own project. As stated multiple times, I want you to be able to get this done quickly
Also, I am allowing a lot of lee-way on this project. Just meet minimum requirements and you can stretch those. I just want to see that you can create a basic MVC app.
Regarding the email portion, it doesn't even have to work but I WILL look at the code.
Add comments to your code.
Divide up the work so this can be done within the 3 hours.

I will be grading this myself

Also, I will go back and take a look at the WPF scores also.
